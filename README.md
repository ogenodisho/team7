SOFTENG 306 Project 2 - team7
=====

**The main code is in the development branch**

1) Copy and paste the .apk file into the android device.

2) From your android device, search for the .apk file. 

3) Run and install the file. 

4) Clear the data of the Agent_7 game (i.e. Settings->Apps->Agent_7:...->Clear data) to ensure that the Achievement system 
works properly (as some of our test data is being persistent for some reason).

5) Play!


We have provided a gmail account for the markers to use with our game so leaderboards and achievements work...
